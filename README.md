# SAAS-PIPELINE-CONVERSION-PROJECT
# Introduction:
TechnoServe, an IT SaaS startup, is currently facing a significant challenge with a declining sales pipeline conversion rate. This rate has dropped from a healthy 35% at the end of the last fiscal year (FY 2017-18) to a concerning 25% at present (first quarter of FY 2018-19). This decline poses a potential threat to the company's growth and profitability, necessitating a thorough understanding of the underlying causes and the development of effective solutions. This project aims to analyze the factors contributing to this drop in conversion and provide actionable recommendations to improve TechnoServe's sales performance.

# Understanding the Problem:
- **Situation:** Lack of details on products, client numbers, employee strength, and sales team size.
- **Problem Areas:** Unknown lead identification process, average conversion time, sales team skills, and product knowledge.
- **Implications:** Unclear impact on company profits, future targets, and sales team morale/performance.
- **Need-Payoff:** Potential revenue increase, employee benefits, use of extra revenue, and impact on market share are yet to be determined if the problem is solved.

# Assignment Objective:
1. Thoroughly understand the reasons behind the declining sales pipeline conversion percentage at TechnoServe.
2. Formulate hypotheses regarding the potential causes of these low conversions.
3. Analyze the provided dataset (which you will provide later) to validate or refute these hypotheses.
4. Based on the analysis, arrive at practical and data-driven solutions aimed at increasing the sales pipeline conversion rate for TechnoServe.

# Methodology:
A structured approach combining the Issue Tree and 5C frameworks will be used. The 5C framework provides a comprehensive view by considering internal and external business factors. The Issue Tree then breaks down the problem of low conversion rates within each of the 5Cs into smaller, manageable potential causes (hypotheses). This combination offers a detailed and organized problem-solving strategy. The low sales pipeline conversion problem is divided into the 5Cs (Customers, Company, Competitors, Collaborators, and Context), and each is further branched using the Issue Tree for granular analysis. This two-layered approach enables a multi-perspective analysis.

# Formulated Hypothesis:

- **Customers:**
1. Targeting - Industry (P1): Mismatched products and leads by industry.
2. Targeting - Budget (P1, P2): Incorrect budget targeting. Limited product budget range.
3. Targeting - Location (P2, P3): Difficulty reaching leads by location. Untapped, easily convertible locations.
4. Sentiment (P2): Perceived low product/service quality. High solution prices.

- **Company:**

1. Products (P0, P1): Products don't solve client issues. Low product quality. Outdated products.
2. Market Reputation: Weak market reputation.
3. Internal - Sales (P2, P3): Inefficient resource allocation. Ineffective sales team. Unrealistic expectations.
4. Internal - Marketing (P0): Lack of effective marketing channels. Inability to identify suitable advertising.

- **Competition:**

1. Competition - Price Comparison (P2): Lower competitor prices.
2. Competition - Product Comparison (P2): Higher competitor product quality. More appealing competitor products.
3. Competition - Services Comparison (P3, P4): Wider competitor reach. Competitor value-added services. More efficient competitor sales teams.
4. Competition - Technology Comparison (P1): Competitor technological advantage.

- **Collaborators:**

1. Distribution Partners (P2): Unfavored distribution channels.
2. Vendors - Hardware Vendors (P3): Low-quality hardware materials. High hardware material costs.
3. Vendors - Software Vendors (P2, P3): High software fees. Outdated software from vendors.

- **Context:**

1. Market (P2): Declining market demand.
2. Technology (P2): Obsolete products due to new technology.
3. Regulations (P2): Negative impact from new regulations.

# Generating Insights:

1. - **ERP Implementation Strength:** TechnoServe has a strong offering and high conversion rates within the ERP Implementation domain.
2. - **Enterprise Seller Effectiveness:** The Enterprise sales team employs successful strategies that lead to higher conversion rates.
3. - **Focus on Smaller Clients:** Clients with a revenue size of $100K or less and opportunities in the $0-30K range show higher conversion probabilities.
4. - **Value of Existing Customers:** Retaining and growing business with existing customers yields better conversion rates than acquiring new ones.
  
  # Recommendations:

1. Focus on ERP Implementation for new leads.
2. Leverage Enterprise Seller strategies.
3. Target smaller client revenue sizes ($100K or less).
4. Prioritize smaller opportunity sizes ($0-30K).
5. Strengthen existing customer relationships.

 # Conclusion:
To improve TechnoServe's sales pipeline conversion, these recommendations advise focusing on ERP Implementation for new leads, leveraging successful Enterprise Seller strategies, and targeting smaller clients and deals. Additionally, strengthening existing customer relationships is crucial. Implementing these focused strategies should help TechnoServe optimize its sales efforts and increase conversion rates.
